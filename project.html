		<p>During early 2019 I was selected as one of 34 students to receive a Westpac Scholarship Young Technologists/W100 Scholarship. This scholarhsip has not provided finanancial support, but has allowed me to make strong friendships and connections with people in the computer science/engineering field thus greatly improving my communction skills. Below is a view of my Alumni profile featured on Westpac's W100 website.</p>

		During the June-July university break, I was selected to recieve a scholarhsip and given the oppurtunity to travel to Xiâ€™an China to take part in a global ICT event in which lectures, workshops and cultural trips were provided. Through my involvement within this event I gained valuable communication skills and formed connections with a diverse range of fellow university students and IT professionals from around the world. Not only was I able to further my ICT education through the various workshops held, but the event greatly benefited me as I have actively been seeking to learn conversational Chinese (Mandarin).</td>
